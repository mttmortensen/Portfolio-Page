            Hey there — I’m a passionate developer and systems admin who loves building cool stuff, solving problems,
            and learning something new every day. Whether it's streamlining IT ops or spinning up full-stack apps, I like to keep my hands in all things tech.

            Outside of code, you’ll probably find me exploring creative projects, tinkering in the homelab, or diving deep into something nerdy.
            This portfolio is a living reflection of where I’ve been, what I’ve built, and where I’m heading.

            Thanks for stopping by — let’s build something awesome.
