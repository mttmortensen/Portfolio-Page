# Portfolio Page (Blazor WASM)

This is my personal portfolio site built with **Blazor WebAssembly**. It highlights my work as a developer, including:

- A featured **About Me** page
- A Projects section showcasing:
  - Knowledge Center API
  - Seinfeld API
  - Knowledge Center frontend
  - SwaggerHub integration

## GitHub-Integrated Blog Feature

As part of this portfolio, I'm also experimenting with a lightweight blog-like feature using **GitHub issue comments**. These comments reflect my thought process as I work on different parts of this project and others—giving you a glimpse into how I break things down and build.

## Tech Stack

- Blazor WebAssembly (C#)
- ASP.NET Core Web API (for connected services)
- GitHub for source control and commit history
- Hosted via static site deployment (TBD)

## Status

Actively in development. More pages and polish coming soon.
